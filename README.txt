What's Good In the Assignment:
I have found the following goods in the given assignment.
1. The code follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which is a good practice for organizing code in web applications.
2. There are comments explaining the purpose of methods and class properties, which is helpful for understanding the code for a developer.
3. The code is generally well-structured and readable.
4. Dependency injection is used in the constructor to inject the "BookingRepository" instance, promoting loose coupling and making the code more testable.
5. The code makes good use of Laravel's Eloquent ORM to retrieve and work with database records. This can make database interactions cleaner and more maintainable.

What Could Be Improved in the given assignment is as under:
1. There are some magic values in the code, such as 'adminemail', 'true', and 'false'. It's a good practice to define such values as constants or configuration settings to make the code more maintainable and avoid potential bugs.
2. The naming conventions for variables and methods should be consistent throughout the codebase. For example, some variables use snake_case ($adminSenderEmail), while others use camelCase ($admincomment). Consistency helps in code readability.
3. Request data should be validated before using it. Laravel provides request validation rules that can be used to validate incoming data.
4. The code lacks proper error handling. It directly returns strings like "Please, add comment" in some cases. It's better to throw exceptions and handle errors gracefully. This can be achieved using Laravel's built-in exception handling.
5. Consider breaking down the controller methods into smaller, more focused methods to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
6. Avoid using env directly in the code. Instead, define these values in the configuration files and access them using Laravel's configuration functions or define as constants.
7. Ensure consistent indentation throughout the code for better readability.
8. Code Duplication can be reduced by using helper functions.
